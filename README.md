River Ice Forecasting Testbed

This repository corresponds to the configuration of the system implemented in Delft-FEWS for testing river ice forecasting procedures. This is the result of a joint collaboration with University of Laval, Deltares USA and Rodolfo Alvarado Montero. The description of the system and the scientific findings have been submitted to the journal Geoscientific Model Development (GMD).

The repository does not contain the binaries of Delft-FEWS software. The binaries of Delft-FEWS can be downloaded directly from https://download.deltares.nl/delft-fews-demo.
